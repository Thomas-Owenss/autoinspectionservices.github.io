    <p>We are a very efficient Christchurch workshop providing a complete vehicle compliance and certification service for imported vehicles and lapsed registrations. <br> <br> If you are importing your own vehicle, we can organise the whole process for you, from arrival in New Zealand to driving away. <br> <br> If you have a vehicle whose registration has been cancelled and you wish to get your vehicle back on the road, we can organise this for you as well. <br> <br> We carry out mechanical repairs, tyre fitting, and servicing for vehicles being complied, and can organise all other repairs as required through our network of trusted repairers. <br> <br> If you are thinking about importing, or buying a vehicle which has no registration please give us a call and we can give you all the information to allow you to make the right decision - the regulations for importing are changing regularly. </p>
