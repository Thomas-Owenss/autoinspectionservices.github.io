    <p>Fortnite Battle Royale, developed and published by Epic Games Inc, and is a PVP (Player vs Player) style game. 100 players are forced to fight against each other in an open world map. Players can choose to play individually, in groups of two, or groups of 4. At the start of the game, players jump from the "Battle Bus" which let's them choose their starting location on the map. After they've landed in their desired location, players must scavenge for weapons, items, resources and even transport to protect themselves and eliminate other players from the match. As time passes throughout the match, the "storm" closes into the map making the area of play smaller and forcing players to engage in combat rather than hiding or avoiding it. The last player, duo, or squad standing is crowned the winner.</p>
