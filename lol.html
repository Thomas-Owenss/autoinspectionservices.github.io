    <p>League of Legends is a mulitplayer online battle arena developed and published by Riot Games. Two teams of five players play in a PVP (Player vs Player) battle with each team defending their half of the map while they attack and conquer the other half. Each of the ten players control a character known as a "Champion" which has unique abilities and individual styles of play. During a match, the Champions increase their strength by collecting XP (Experience Points), purchasing items to defeat the opponents, and earning gold. In the games main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by attacking the opposing team's base and destroying their "Nexus", which is located within the base. </p>
