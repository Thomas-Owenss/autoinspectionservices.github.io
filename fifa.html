    <p>Football games have been developed for decades dating back to the late 80s, which game the Sports gaming community Tehkan World Cup, Sensible Soccer, Kick Off and Match Day. These games were the building blocks to the popularity and quality of football games in this day and age. In 1993, developer EA Games released FIFA International Football. The game was immediately a hit and the developers have since released a game annually. A notable feat of this series is that at its time of original release in 1993, this game was the only one of its kind to have an official license from FIFA, the world governing body of football. The main series of FIFA has since included extras such as professional tournament like the UEFA Champions League, FIFA World Cup, and a series of football management titles.</p>
