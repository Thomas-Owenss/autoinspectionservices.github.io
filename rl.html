    <p>Rocket League, the successor to Super Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars, is described as "football but with rocket powered cars. Rocket League games have either 2 players going head to head against each other, two teams of two, two teams of three, or even two teams of four. Using rocket-powered cars, the objective of the game is to hit a spherical ball into the oppositions goal area. The matches last for 5 minutes, and the team with the most goals scored wins however if the game ends with a draw, the two teams duke it out in "overtime" which sees the team who scores the first goal in this extra time crowned as winners. Rocket League includes single-player and multi-player modes which can be played either locally or online, and includes cross-platform play with all platforms out there between all versions. More recent updates to the game enabled "mutators", which lets the players modify the games to their likings and added new game modes which included ice hockey, basketball, and gridiron (American Football).</p>
